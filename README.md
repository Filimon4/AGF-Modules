# AGF-Modules
Hi, i just wanna create scripts of all modules(Server/Client) in [AeroGameFramework](https://github.com/Sleitnick/AeroGameFramework) for me to remember it. I just decided to publish it on github with hope that it can help any one else. Maybe in one day i decide to make the same with [Knit](https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit).
<br /><br />
For now it's not finish product. In the repository there is only client modules: Fade and UserInput.
<br />
Client modules in ./scr/Client/Controllers/_NameOfModule_TestController.
